# Your rule content

- Always use LUA5.1.
- Never use LUA5.2.
- Never, EVER, EVER, EVER, introduce stuff like "Goto continue" or ":::continue:::" or "table.unpack", because it is not LUA5.1
- Never use "//" as comments, always use "--"
- Never abbreviate or "yeah remaining code stays the same", always print the whole function in full.
